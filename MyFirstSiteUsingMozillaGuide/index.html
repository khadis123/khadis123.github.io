    <h1 class="center">Is Bitcoin money or not?<h1>
    <img src="images/bitcoin1.jpg" alt="Bitcoin image" width="600px" height="auto" class="center">
    <p>The answer is yes and no. Don't worry. I'll explain you what it means.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, bitcoin is money, but the biggest difference is it has no central authority
      controlling it like FRS and the exact amount of money to be coined / issued is known in
      advance to all. Actually, it's been programmatically defined by the Bitcoin creator called
      Satoshi Nakamoto (this is his nickname).</p>

      <p>There're 5 main functions of money:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Medium of exchange</li>
  <li>Measure of value</li>
  <li>Standard of deferred payment</li>
  <li>Store of value</li>
  <li>International money</li>
</ul>

<p>There're some variations of the functions given above but you
  got the bigger picture and it's enough for now. In case if you
  want to know more, read this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money" target="_blank">article.</p>
